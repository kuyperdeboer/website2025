      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi! My name is Kuyper DeBoer. I am a Mechanical Engineering Major at Virginia Tech, set to graduate in May of 2028. I created this website mainly to host my 
        engineering project write-ups. These are for engineering related projects I complete by myself that I feel are good enough to share professionally.
        A big hobby of mine is photography, so I figured this website would also be a good place to include my photo portfolio online. If you want to contact me for
        any reason my school (work) email is kuyper@vt.edu, and you can also connect with me on LinkedIn, which is linked on the homepage of this website.
